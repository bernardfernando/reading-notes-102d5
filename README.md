**Growth mindset**  
A growth mindset is a belief that you can develop your skills and talents throught hardwork, the right strategies guidance from others.
(Mindset is the series of beliefs people hold about themselves - their self-perception.

_I like taking challenges, When I want to do something I persist with it (and when I get results, bingo!), It is no pain, no gain - 100% agree, I try learning from my mistakes (arguably...lol), I admire others success and try taking on board their example (still I am in trying stage...lol)_  

- I have identified my mindset. it has definitely been Growth Mindset. I have experienced this myself - hardwork will give results, in sports, education and any other domain.
- Look at my own improvement - most are sheer hardwork.
- Look at the success of others who have leaped up from where they were.
- I love getting feedback.
- Learn things new - I love to learn, be it a sport, language, musical instrument.  I have seen myself  how hardwork helps.
- I did not like to make mistakes, so I would spend hours to find right answers. That is again hardwork, but still make mistakes.
