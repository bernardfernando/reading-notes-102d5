#Software Requirements

# Project: Drinks Co customer complaints front end and backend

## Vision

## What is the vision of this product?

### Prepare a customer complaints log completed by either a consumer or a company employee that will produce running customer complains list, summary and graphs enabling the management to prioratise corrective and preventive action.

## What pain point does this project solve?

### Lack of having a portal based system takes longer to key-in and also analysis has to be done regularly for the management, which takes man-hours. Ability for both staff and the consumer to do this task will further remove man-hours from staff.

## Why should we care about your product?

### This will make logging of complaints more efficient and reduce time spent on a task that can be delegated to the consumer and be able to use the time saved for other important tasks.

# Scope (In/Out)

## IN - What will your product do

### This app will allow consumer or customer complaitns to be logged by the customer or consumer by using a web-form. This task can be done by a staff member when a consumer or a customer does not have access to the web or is not conversant with the web.

### this will collect complaints data using a webform and store in an Array (or a database - stretch goals)

### Filter them into daily (Weekly, yearly) summaries.

### will produce graphs with trends

## OUT - What will your product not do.

### This will not allow the consumer/customer/staff member to update or edit the complaint once it is submitted.

### This will have to be completed in one go - local storage may help and this could go under stretch goals

## Minimum Viable Product vs

### What will your MVP functionality be?

#### Logging customer complaints using a webform, preparation of summary and graphs.

## What are your stretch goals?

### Including a label design survey to pick a label for a new product.

### (using local storage enabel the user to resume completion)

### (Design a complete QA/LIMS system for a Drinks Company)

## Stretch

### What stretch goals are you going to aim for?

### Include a survey to select a label design for products by employees;

## Functional Requirements

List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:

### Consumers and customers can only key in information to the form

### Staff members authorised to have access can change the form

### Once the form is submitted customer/consumer/staff-member who key in data cannot change the form

## Data Flow

1. ### Customer consumber visit the website
2. ### Go to customer complaints page via a navigation button on the Home page
3. ### Complete the form
4. ### Submit it
5. ### Process using javascript
6. ### provide a summary of complaints when required

Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.

Examples include:

Security
Usability
Testability
etc….
Pick 2 non-functional requirements and describe their functionality in your application.

If you are stuck on what non-functional requirements are, do a quick online search and do some research. Write a minimum of 3-5 sentences to describe how the non-functional requirements fits into your app.
Performance/Scalability - this has to be improved with using a backend database.

You MUST describe what the non-functional requirement is and how it will be implemented. Simply saying “Our project will be testable for testibility” is NOT acceptable. Tell us how, why, and what
