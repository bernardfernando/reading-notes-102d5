Reading
Domain Modeling

Explain why we need domain modeling.

HTML Table Basics

#Why should tables not be used for page layouts?
1. Confuses screen reading software.
2. Table tags are more complex and the coding is harder to write, maintain and debug.
3. Tables are not automatically responsive. proper layouts are better responsive (header, sections,  artile, div) width defaults to 100% of their parent element. Tables get sized based on their content.

List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML <table>.
Introducing Constructors
<table> whole table
<tr> table row
<th> table header
<td> table cell

# What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?
It is a special method or a class or a structure in object-oriented programming that initializes a newly created object of that type. Whenever an object is created the constructed is called automatically.

## How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?
_Main difference is what you can do with it. With the constructor function notation you create an object that can be instantiated into multiple instances (with the new keyword) , while the literal notation delivers a single object._

Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.
