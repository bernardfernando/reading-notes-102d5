Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the upcoming lecture.

Go through these resources, and create a page in your reading-notes repo that summarizes what you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

+ ##**Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)**##
Blog post is any article, news piece or guided that publishes in the blog section of a website. This covers specific topic or query, is educational in nature ranges from anything between 500 to 3000 (this is just a vague figure)
+ > ###**Why Learn Markdown**
>"_If you have worked on any GitHub repo, you would have surely seen a README.md file, this is the markdown file where you can describe your repo. Markdown is easy to learn. It is helpful in writing questions on forums like StackOverflow,useful in commenting on Pull Request in Github, etc. It is a quick way to generated formatted text._

_VS Code had inbuilt support for Markdown with the preview mode for generated HTML._"

+ ###**Dictionary / Flash Cards**
>"_Flashcards are a study or memorisation tool, with information on one or both sides. Using flashcards is a versatile learning strategy that benefits students of all ages. They can be different colours, or kept simple_"

#**Read Carefully**#
The following pages will give you a step by step introduction to using a terminal. While it refers to Linux, the same commands are available in macOS and Windows (with WSL). Read through these pages carefully. Don’t worry about trying this out on your own system yet, that will come very soon. For now, take notes on how commands are used, and which look similar to how you are used to using the GUI File Explorer/Finder.

1. **The Command Line**: Command Line Interface is a text based editing environment.  It uses specified text (commands) to interact with the computer and perform numerous operations, including installation and work with programs. Every operating system comes with an inbuilt command prompt.

2. **Basic Navigation**: CLI allows a user to navigate the filesystem and run built in programs or custom scripts. 
3. **About Files:** [More about files](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/aboutfiles.php)

Answer
1. **What are four important features to look for in a text editor?**
> _Basic features of a text editor include the ability to cut, paste and copy text, find and replace words or characters, create bulleted lists, line-wrap text, and undo or redo a last command. They're also equipped to open very large files (too big for a computer's main memory to process) and read them at speed._

2. **Basic features of a good Code Editor**
> _Code editors have a range of features, including color-coded syntax highlighting, automatic indentation, error-checking, auto-completing with suggested code, and code snippets. They also facilitate the Developer's navigation of code files and resources._

3. **What do the following commands do?**
+ ##**pwd**: 
> _The pwd command writes to standard output the full path name of your current directory (from the root directory). All directories are separated by a / (slash). The root directory is represented by the first /, and the last directory named is your current directory._
+##**ls:** 
This is a command used on CLI, which shows the directories and files in the current directory.
+ ##**cd**
change directory command. you may change directory from current to an existing one using this command syntax **'cd <name of a directory in the current directory>'**


+ ##**mkdir**
The is 'make directory' command.  This creates a new directory in the current directory. syntax  **mkdir <new name for new directory>**
touch
Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)

+**cd projects** - this will change the current directory down to another existing in current directory

+##**mkdir new-project**: 
this will create a new directory named 'new-projects' in current directory.

+##**touch new-project/newfile.md**
This will add a new 'markdown' file to 'new-project' directory named newfile.md

+##**cd ..**  to go up one directory in the path, eg current /dir 1_1/dir 1_2/dir 1_3  cd .. <return> will make the path /dir 1_1\dir 1_2/  (go one step up in directory path)

+**ls projects/new-project**: this will list all directories in /projects/new-projec/ directory (only the ones in new-project directory)
