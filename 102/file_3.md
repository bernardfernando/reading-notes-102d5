**#Practice with Git**
Try out the workflow from the in-class workshop with another repo.

**Setup and Documentation**
Clone down your reading-notes repo to your local computer, so you can do all future work in VS Code.

**Requirements**
+ +Continue to practice writing Markdown!
+ Review your past reading-notes entries.
+ Correct any typos
+ Fix any errors
+ Bulk up any areas that look thin

+ Build out your site structure

+ Create a new directory for your 102 notes with 8 files: completed.

+ Create a new directory for your 201 notes with 15 files: completed

+ Each topic you’ve written about should have its own page

# The home page should contain only:

## **Your introduction**: completed
## A description of what this website is about
## A Table of Contents
## Use Markdown to create a link from the Table of Contents to the topic’s page : completed.

Table of Contents should have:
Heading for Code 102 Reading Notes
8 links to current and future 102 Reading notes

Heading for Code 201 Reading Notes
15 links to future 201 Reading notes

## Keep a clean git history
After every meaningful change, A-C-P.

# git add .
# git status

Wait for message

# git commit -m "<message>
# git status

wait for message

# git push
# git status

Write commit messages that explain WHY you made your changes, not what the changes were.

Stretch Goals
What did this exercise teach you? Add an additional page to your reading-notes site to document your thoughts and observations.
This teaches:
+ Creating a repository on Github
+ Cloning it on local Ubuntu directory (SSH code, copying)
+ Creating directories on Cloned Directory on local Ubuntu/VS
+ Setting up files on local Ubuntu CL/VS
+ Transfering it using git add, git commit -m "<reason> " and git push (when status in each stage states as complete)
