
**#Practice with Git**
Try out the workflow from the in-class workshop with another repo.

**Setup and Documentation**
Clone down your reading-notes repo to your local computer, so you can do all future work in VS Code.

**Requirements**
+ +Continue to practice writing Markdown!
+ Review your past reading-notes entries.
+ Correct any typos
+ Fix any errors
+ Bulk up any areas that look thin

+ Build out your site structure

+ Create a new directory for your 102 notes with 8 files: completed.

+ Create a new directory for your 201 notes with 15 files: completed

+ Each topic you’ve written about should have its own page

# The home page should contain only:

## **Your introduction**: completed
## A description of what this website is about
## A Table of Contents
## Use Markdown to create a link from the Table of Contents to the topic’s page : completed.

Table of Contents should have:
Heading for Code 102 Reading Notes
8 links to current and future 102 Reading notes

Heading for Code 201 Reading Notes
15 links to future 201 Reading notes

## Keep a clean git history
After every meaningful change, A-C-P.

# git add .
# git status

Wait for message

# git commit -m "<message>
# git status

wait for message

# git push
# git status

Write commit messages that explain WHY you made your changes, not what the changes were.

Stretch Goals
What did this exercise teach you? Add an additional page to your reading-notes site to document your thoughts and observations.
This teaches:
+ Creating a repository on Github
+ Cloning it on local Ubuntu directory (SSH code, copying)
+ Creating directories on Cloned Directory on local Ubuntu/VS
+ Setting up files on local Ubuntu CL/VS
+ Transfering it using git add, git commit -m "<reason> " and git push (when status in each stage states as complete)

# Reflection and Discussion
Below is a collection of resources of varying types and lengths which describe the topics for the lecture.

Go through these resources, and create a page in your reading-notes repo that summarizes the topics you learned as though you were presenting the material to a non-technical friend interested in learning about it.

Notes entry ideas:

Blog Article (2-3 paragraphs with code sample)
Dictionary / Flash Cards
Notes in outline form
Fill-in-the-blank worksheet of key concepts
Read
Git Intro
Read only up through the section called “Seeing Your Remote”.
Feel free to skim the “Getting Started” instructions, do not follow along with that section for now.
Answer
# What is Version Control?
> <Version Control is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes. Through version control, one can revert a file or project to a previous version, track modifications and modifying individuals, and compare changes. By utilizing a Version Control System (VCS), mistakes with files can easily be rectifie>

Git is a distributed version control system (DVCS): this allows multiple mirrored repositories to be created.


What is cloning in Git? This feature allows an exact copy of an existing  repository to be done on multiple computers.

## **What is the command to track and stage files?**
+ ### git add <file name>
+ ### git status 
    this will show if the file is ready/staged to be committed.

+ ## What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
    git commit -a

+ # What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
    git push
